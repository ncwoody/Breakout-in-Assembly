# Breakout-in-Assembly
My version of Breakout for Atari done in Assembly

Coded in the CSC 314 class at DSU taught by Ivy (sorry, can't spell her last name off the top of my head)
Contains a decent amount of code which was given to me to have something to start
Does not contain the necessary files to be able to compile the program or the text file which is the game board
Just the code contained here cause I thought it was a cool project and wanted to keep it in case I ever wanted to revisit it
